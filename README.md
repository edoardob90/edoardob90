  * [#18b3030](https://github.com/edoardob90/dayone-to-obsidian/commit/18b3030) Adapt formatting to &#34;LYT mode&#34; (#1)

* Change Markdown formatting

Adapted to my new vaul structure based on LYT

* Cleanup

* Handle status tags; tag journal names

* Update README.md

* Typo

* Use rich library for output

* Drop click.echo
* Add the --vault-directory option to skip files already exported

* Cleanup

* Fix regex for matching audio attachments
* Refactor for a more logical flow
* Change formatting of some output messages

* Refactor: user-defined &#39;Entry&#39; class

Simpler and more readable code using a new `Entry` class
It represents a single entry and contains a few utility methods:
* default str representation
* add_metadata
* dump to file

* Renamed processed JSON journals

Processed journal files are prepended a number
to keep track of multiple imports.
You MUST take care of copying Markdown files
because they&#39;re deleted every time the script is run.
